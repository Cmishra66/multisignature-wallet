Technologies Used:

Solidity: Smart contract programming language.
OpenZeppelin Contracts: Reusable smart contract components following best practices.
tested using foundry.

Efficiency Considerations:

Gas Costs: The contract design minimizes gas usage by using mappings and efficient data structures.
Transaction Execution: Transactions are executed atomically to minimize the risk of reentrancy attacks.
Signature Count: The contract stores the number of required approvals to optimize gas costs.
Dynamic Owners: The contract allows dynamic addition and removal of owners.
Certainly! Below is an example of a test document outlining various test cases for the Multi-Signature Wallet Smart Contract. Please note that these test cases are illustrative, and additional test scenarios may be needed based on the specific requirements and functionalities of the contract.

   - Existing owners: [Owner1, Owner2, Owner3]
   - New owner: Owner4

2. **Actions:**
   - Owner1 adds Owner4.

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Owner4 is added successfully.
   - Owner4 is included in the list of owners.

## Test Case 3: Remove Owner

**Objective:** Verify the removal of an existing owner.

1. **Input:**
   - Existing owners: [Owner1, Owner2, Owner3, Owner4]

2. **Actions:**
   - Owner1 removes Owner4.

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Owner4 is removed successfully.
   - Owner4 is not included in the list of owners.

## Test Case 4: Submit Transaction

**Objective:** Test the submission of a new transaction.

1. **Input:**
   - Transaction details: [To: Receiver, Value: 1 ETH, Data: SomeData]

2. **Actions:**
   - Owner1 submits a new transaction.

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Transaction is created successfully.
   - Transaction details are accurate.

## Test Case 5: Approve Transaction

**Objective:** Test the approval of a submitted transaction.

1. **Input:**
   - Submitted transaction index: 0

2. **Actions:**
   - Owner1 approves the transaction.

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Transaction status is marked as approved.
   - Approval event is emitted.

## Test Case 6: Cancel Transaction

**Objective:** Test the cancellation of a submitted transaction.

1. **Input:**
   - Submitted transaction index: 0

2. **Actions:**
   - Owner2 cancels the transaction.

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Transaction status is marked as canceled.
   - Cancellation event is emitted.

## Test Case 7: Execute Transaction

**Objective:** Test the execution of an approved transaction.

1. **Input:**
   - Approved transaction index: 0

2. **Actions:**
   - Owner1 executes the transaction.

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Transaction is executed successfully.
   - Execution event is emitted.

## Test Case 8: Claim Refund

**Objective:** Test the claim of a refund for a canceled transaction.

1. **Input:**
   - Canceled transaction index: 0

2. **Actions:**
   - Owner2 claims a refund for the canceled transaction.

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Refund is claimed successfully.
   - Refund event is emitted.

## Test Case 9: Contract State After Multiple Transactions

**Objective:** Test the overall state of the contract after multiple transactions.

1. **Input:**
   - Multiple submitted, approved, canceled, and executed transactions.

2. **Expected Result:**
   - Owners, transactions, and their statuses are accurately maintained.
   - Required approvals are enforced correctly.
